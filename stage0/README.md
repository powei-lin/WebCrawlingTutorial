First, we want to find some patterns on the website.

The first thing I noticed was that there's a `id` in the URL.

<img src=../imgs/s0_0.png alt="id in url" width="640" /></a>

On the front page. It says there are 291 active projects.
<img src=../imgs/s0_1.png alt="id in url" width="640" /></a>

So there are few things we need to find out.

1. Does the `id` start from 0 or 1?
2. Are the first 291 projects active projects? Or the `id` is randomly assigned.
